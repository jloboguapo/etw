Itâ€™s not uncommon\n              to see some improvement with this approach for a short time. But because the solution wasnâ€™t complete, over 90% of the time the improvements plateau or even reverse. ETW is the only sustainable long-term solution.</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <!--\n\n    MOS\n\n    -->\n    <section class=\"hero is-light about-mos m-y-2\">\n      <div class=\"hero-body\">\n        <div class=\"columns\">\n          <div class=\"column is-6 is-offset-5\">\n            <div class=\"m-b-2 m-t-3 sr-up\">\n              <h5 class=\"has-text-grey\">MANAGEMENT OPERATING SYSTEM</h5>\n              <h1 class=\"title is-1\">When is the best time to implement ETW?</h1>\n            </div>\n            <p class=\"m-b-2 is-size-5 sr-up-delay\">Any time is the right time to get your organization more aligned. That said, the more chaotic and busy with new projects you are, the better the timing. Staying on top of all the complexities of making an organization successful without a centralized\n              Management Operating System takes extreme effort. ETW gets you aligned fast and with less than half the effort required going forward to keep it that way. This allows you to be much more proactive and less reactive in growing your organization.\n              And because the ETW team does all the work for you (no learning how to set up a new system) until the system is fully built out, you spend all of your time proactively improving your organizationâ€™s alignment and results. ETW is cloud-based,\n              can be deployed in less than 24 hours and requires zero IT support on your end. ETW is very secure and all you need is a modern browser.</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <!--\n\n    LEADERSHIP CARDS SECTION TITLE\n\n    -->\n    <section class=\"hero hero-senior-leadership\">\n      <div class=\"hero-body\">\n        <div class=\"columns is-centered\">\n          <div class=\"column is-8\">\n            <div class=\"has-text-centered\">\n              <h1 class=\"title sr-up\">\n                Senior Leadership\n              </h1>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <!--\n\n    SENIOR LEADERSHIP CARDS\n\n    -->\n    <section class=\"section\">\n      <div class=\"columns is-multiline is-variable is-8\">\n        <div\n            class=\"column is-one-third-desktop is-6-tablet m-b-3 sr-up\"\n            v-for=\"leader in seniorLeadership\"\n            v-bind:key=\"leader.name\">\n          <figure class=\"image m-b-2\">\n            <img v-bind:src=\"leader.image\" v-bind:alt=\"leader.name\">\n          </figure>\n          <div class=\"columns is-mobile is-gapless\">\n            <div class=\"column\">\n              <h1 class=\"title is-4\">{{ leader.name }}</h1>\n              <h2 class=\"subtitle is-6\">{{ leader.title }}</h2>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"column is-narrow\">\n              <a v-bind:href=\"leader.linkedin\" class=\"image is-32x32\" target=\"_blank\">\n                <img src=\"/images/socials/linkedin_icon.svg\" alt=\"View LinkedIn Profile\">\n              </a>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <p>{{ leader.info }}</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n\n  </div>\n  <!-- end of container -->\n\n</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n\n  metaInfo () { return this.$store.getters['meta/showByPage']('about') },\n\n  data () {\n    return {\n      seniorLeadership: [\n        {\n          image: '/images/headshots/lb-1-min.jpg',\n          name: 'Lee Benson',\n          title: 'CEO and Founder',\n          info: 'Lee Benson is the founder and CEO of Execute to Win, a Phoenix-based company that helps organizations drive alignment to winning behaviors and performance through business management systems.
