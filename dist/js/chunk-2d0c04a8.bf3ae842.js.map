Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT BE EMPOWERED AND DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO HEAR OR DECIDE ANY CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, TO AWARD PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR TO AWARD ATTORNEYS’ FEES TO THE PREVAILING PARTY.</p>\n            <p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by providing written notice of your intention to do so to ETW within 60 days of the earlier of your first use of the ETW Platform or your registration with the ETW Platform.</p>\n            <p>By receiving the ETW Professional Services or using the ETW Platform, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Arizona, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement (including the Privacy Policy incorporated herein by reference) and any dispute or claim of any sort that might arise between you and ETW.
