Users may or may not be employees of the Customer.  This User Agreement is a legally binding contract between ETW and you, the prospective user reading these words.  Even though you are accessing the ETW Platform pursuant to rights purchased by the Customer who authorized you to access the ETW Platform, you must agree to comply with this User Agreement if you access or use the ETW Platform. If you have any questions over this document or what legal terms apply to your use of the Professional Services or ETW Platform, please contact ETW at support@etw.com.

                <p>By accessing or using the ETW Platform, or by clicking to accept or agree to the User Agreement when this option is made available, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree, without limitation or qualification, to be bound and abide by the User Agreement, which include our Privacy Policy, incorporated herein by reference.  If you do not wish to agree to the User Agreement or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the ETW Platform.

The ETW Platform is offered and available to users who are eighteen (18) years of age or older.  By using the ETW Platform you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with ETW.

Also, please note that we may revise and update this User Agreement from time to time in our sole discretion.  All changes are effective immediately when posted and apply to all access to and use of the ETW Platform thereafter.

                <h3>NOTICE REGARDING DISPUTE RESOLUTION:</h3>

                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>

                <h3>6. Your Use Rights and Termination of such Rights</h3>
                <p>This User Agreement remains in effect until your Customer's subscription for you expires or is terminated, or your access to the ETW Platform has been terminated by the Customer or ETW.  Please contact your Customer if you at any time wish to terminate your use of the ETW Platform, including due to any disagreement with this User Agreement. </p>
                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>

                <h3>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</h3>
                <p>If ETW believes that there is a violation of the Customer Agreement or this User Agreement, or any of our other polices that may be remedied by Customer's removal of Customer Data or terminating a User's rights, ETW will usually ask the Customer to take this action rather than intervening directly.  However, ETW may take action when ETW believes it is appropriate and take action (such as suspending your User account) if Customer does not take appropriate action or ETW believes that there is a credible risk of harm to ETW, the ETW Platform, Users or any third parties.
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Neither ETW nor any of our affiliated companies, employees, agents, consultants, contractors, members, or managers ('ETW Affiliates') shall be cumulatively liable for (a) any damages in excess of US $100, or (b) any special, incidental, indirect, punitive or consequential damages or loss of use, profit, revenue or data to you or any third person arising from your use of the Professional Services or ETW Platform, or any of the content or other materials on, accessed through or downloaded from ETW. This limitation of liability is part of the basis of the bargain between the parties and without it the terms and prices charged would be different. This limitation of liability shall:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>A.</strong> Apply regardless of whether (1) you base your claim on contract, tort, statute or any other legal theory, (2) we knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages, or (3) the limited remedies provided in this section fail of their essential purpose; and</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>B.</strong> Not apply to any damage that ETW may cause you intentionally in violation of this User Agreement or applicable law, or as otherwise mandated by applicable law that cannot be disclaimed from in this User Agreement.</p>
                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>

                <h3>8. Notices and Service of Process</h3>
                <p>Notices to ETW shall be sent to 25 S. Arizona Place, Ste. 510, Chandler, AZ 85225.  </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p> Except as expressly provided for otherwise in this User Agreement, ETW shall provide all notices to you under this User Agreement by email, although we may instead choose to provide notice to you through the ETW Platform.  For purposes of messages and notices about the ETW Platform applicable to all users, ETW may place a banner notice across the ETW Platform to alert you. You also agree that ETW may communicate with you through your ETW account or through other means including email, mobile number, telephone, or delivery services including the postal service, about your ETW account or services associated with ETW. You acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability associated with or arising from your failure to maintain accurate contact or other information, including, but not limited to, your failure to receive critical information about the ETW Platform.</p>
                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>

                <h3>9. No informal waivers, agreements or representations.</h3>
                <p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach of this User Agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to that breach or subsequent similar or other breaches. No representations, statements, consents, waivers or other acts or omissions by any ETW Affiliate shall be deemed legally binding on any ETW Affiliate, unless documented in a physical writing hand signed by a duly appointed officer of ETW. </p>
                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>

                <h3>10. Severability.</h3>
                <p>In the event that any provision of this User Agreement is unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not affect the other provisions of this User Agreement and this User Agreement shall be construed as if such unenforceable or invalid provision had never been contained herein. </p>
                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>

                <h3>11. Assignment and Delegation.</h3>
                <p>You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under this User Agreement. Any purported assignment and delegation shall be ineffective. We may freely assign or delegate all rights and obligations under this User Agreement, fully or partially without notice to you. We may also substitute, effective upon notice to you, ETW for any third party that assumes our rights and obligations under this User Agreement.</p>
                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>

                <h3>12.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h3>
                <p>Except as set forth below, ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM ARISING UNDER THIS USER AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE PRIVACY POLICY INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND ETW PLATFORM WILL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT; provided, however, that the following are exceptions to our agreement to arbitrate our disputes:
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><strong>a)</strong>	Any claim that qualifies as a small claim in a court of limited subject matter jurisdiction must be brought in such court; and </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><strong>b)</strong>	Any claim for injunctive relief may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin intellectual property infringement or misuse.  </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>You may begin an arbitration proceeding by following the American Arbitration Association’s (AAA’s) filing requirements and mailing a request for arbitration and description of your claim to us at 25 S. Arizona Place, Ste. 510, Chandler, AZ 85225.  The AAA’s Rules of Commercial Arbitration will apply (available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879).  The arbitrator will have the power to rule on any challenge to its own jurisdiction or to the validity or enforceability of any portion of this agreement to arbitrate.
