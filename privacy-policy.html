By accessing the ETW website at www.etw.com, including all related pages and including any subscription based features or services offered by ETW (collectively, the "Site"), you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, do not access or use the Site.  By accessing or using the Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy, which is part of, and governed by, the ETW User Agreement. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Please email us with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy and our privacy practices at <a href="mailto:support@etw.com">support@etw.com</a> or at our mailing address, 25 S. Arizona Place, Ste. 510, Chandler, AZ 85225.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>NOTICE REGARDING DISPUTE RESOLUTION: </strong> Any disputes or claims arising under this Privacy Policy, or relating in any way to your use of the Site, will be resolved by final and binding arbitration as provided for in the ETW User Agreement.

                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>

                <h2>2. What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
                <p>This policy covers ETW's collection and use of information that ETW gathers when you are on the Site and any emails, texts or other electronic communications sent through the Site. This Privacy Policy DOES NOT apply to information collected offline, through any other apps or websites (including websites you may access through the Site) or by any third party.  These other websites, apps or third parties may have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to read before providing information through them. </p>
                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>

                <h2>3. What Information Does ETW Collect?</h2>
                <p>ETW collects information from and about users of our Site: (i) directly from you when you provide it to us; and (ii) automatically when you use the Site.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>3.1 Information You Provide to Us.</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong>  When you access or use the Site we may ask you to provide personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"). For example, we require customers who register to use the Site to give us the following personal information: their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the identity of users within the organization that will be using the Site. When you initially express interest obtaining additional information about the Site, or when you register for the Site, we may also ask for additional types of personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, etc. We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized experience or verify your passwords. </li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Data: </strong> Any content or information submitted by users of the Site is referred to herein as "Customer Data". Customer Data is controlled by the ETW customer who created the user account from which the Customer Data was submitted.  ETW collects or processes Customer Data on behalf of this Customer, not the user who submitted it.   Examples of Customer Data include customized attributes and the canonical data models.  If you are using the Site at the invitation of a Customer, whether that Customer is your employer or not, that Customer determines its own policies, including without limitation policies regarding permissions, storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing and retention of Customer Data which may apply to your use of the Site.  Please consult with your Customer about the policies and settings it has in place. </li>
                  </ul>

If we do not offer an opt out for certain information which you do not want us to collect, please do not access or use the Site, or, if you have already accessed or used the Site, stop doing so immediately and delete the Site from your devices.  We also may use, or work with third parties who use, these technologies to collect information about your activities over time and across third-party websites, apps or other online services (behavioral tracking).</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Do Not Track (DNT) signals are signals sent through a browser informing us that you do not want to be tracked.  We do not assign any meaning to DNT signals as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Information Collection Technologies. </strong> The technologies we use for automatic information collection may include cookies (or mobile cookies) or web beacons.  Cookies are small files sent to and stored on the computer or device you use to access or use our Site.  Cookies may be used to monitor use of our Site, customize content specific to your interests, ensure that you do not see the same advertisements repeatedly and store your user name and password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you access or use the Site. It may be possible to refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your computer or device.  However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain portions of our Site.  </li>
                      <li><strong>Third-Party Information Collection.</strong> When you access or use the Site, or access their content, certain third parties, such as advertisers, analytics companies (e.g. Google Analytics), your mobile device manufacturer or your mobile service provider may use automatic information collection technologies to collect information about you, your computer or your device.  The information these third parties collect may be associated with your personal information or your online or mobile activities over time and across different websites, apps and other online services websites.  Such third parties may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.  We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used.  If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.  You may opt-out of third party cookies from Google Analytics on its website.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>&nbsp;</h2>

                  <p><strong>4.2 Other Data.</strong>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong>  We use personal information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, to:  (i) provide you with the Site and its contents, and any other information, products or services that you request from us; (ii) maintain and improve the Site; (iii) fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it; (iv) give you notices about your account/subscription, including expiration and renewal notices (which notices are considered part of the Site and for which you cannot opt out); (v) carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection; and (vi) communicate with you concerning your use the Site, including sending notices when updates are available, and of changes to any products or services we offer or provide through the Site (which notices are considered part of the Site and for which you cannot opt out).

ETW may use such information in any way ETW determines, in its sole discretion, including to provide research, advice and information, for benchmarking purposes (e.g. we may publish an industry white paper that uses data collected through the use of our Service), and for marketing purposes (e.g. by listing overall number of goals created, improvements, changes in status, screen captures, etc.). This type of collective data enables us to determine how often users use parts of the Site so we can make the Site appealing to as many customers as possible.</li>
                  </ul>
