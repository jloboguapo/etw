                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>Execute To Win<sup>TM</sup> ("ETW") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. ETW has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p>
                <p>By accessing the ETW website at www.etw.com, including all related pages and including any subscription based features or services offered by ETW ("Site"), you are accepting the practices outlined in this Statement.</p>
                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>

                <h2>1. What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
                <p>This policy covers ETW's collection and use of personal information that ETW gathers when you are on the Site and when you use the Service. This Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that ETW does not own or control, or to individuals that ETW does not employ or manage. For avoidance of doubt, this policy does not apply to any third party information gathered by ETW's subscribers and submitted by them to the Service for use in connection with their employee evaluations ("Customer Data"). ETW will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the User Agreement or as may be required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer Data may at times be viewed or accessed by ETW for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or for investigating a suspected violation of the User Agreement, or as may be required by law. ETW adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by US Department of Commerce ("Safe Harbor Principles") with respect to Customer Data that we receive from our customers and other business partners in the European Economic Area.</p>
                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>

                <h2>2. What Personal Information About Customers Does ETW Collect?</h2>
                <p>ETW collects identifying information when you use the Service, when you visit the Site (including, without limitation, any ETW web pages or landing pages), and when you enter promotions or contests. For example, we require customers who register to use the Service to give us the following personal information: their name, Company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the identity of users within the organization that will be using the Service. When you initially express interest obtaining additional information about the Service, or when you register for the Service, we may also ask for additional types of personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, etc. We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized experience or verify your passwords.</p>
                <p>All financial and billing information that we collect from you is used for the purposes of checking your qualifications as a prospective customer and billing you for the Service. Such billing information is not used by ETW for marketing or promotional purposes. ETW may use a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card and billing processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card and billing processing.</p>

We may use this information to provide research, advice and information, including, without limitation, for benchmarking purposes (e.g. we may publish an industry white paper that uses data collected through the use of our Service). This data is only used in the aggregate. This type of collective data also enables us to determine how often customers use parts of the Service so we can make the Service appealing to as many customers as possible. We may share this type of statistical data so that parties with relationships with us may also understand how often people use areas of our Site and our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience.</p>
