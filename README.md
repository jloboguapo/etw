## Setup

Before you can work the application you need to ensure that you have node installed.

To install node, you will first need Homebrew for mac.

```
https://brew.sh/
```

Once you install Homebrew, open a terminal window and type:

```
brew install node
```

> To test if you have node, open a terminal window and type:
```
which node
```

## Running the Application Locally

From your terminal window, navigate to the root folder of the application. For example, if you have placed the app files in your documents folder under www, you would navigate to the folder by typing:
```
cd Documents/www
```

From the root folder, type:
```
npm start
```

This should start the application by launching your default web browser.
