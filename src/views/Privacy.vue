              <p><strong>NOTICE REGARDING DISPUTE RESOLUTION:</strong> Any disputes or claims arising under this Privacy Policy, or relating in any way to your use of the Site, will be resolved by final and binding arbitration as provided for in the <router-link :to="{name: 'user-agreement'}">ETW User Agreement</router-link>.

              <h2 class="m-t-4">What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
              <p>This policy covers ETW's collection and use of information that ETW gathers when you are on the Site and any emails, texts or other electronic communications sent through the Site. This Privacy Policy DOES NOT apply to information collected offline, through any other apps or websites (including websites you may access through the Site) or by any third party. These other websites, apps or third parties may have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to read before providing information through them.</p>

              <h2 class="m-t-4">What Information Does ETW Collect?</h2>
              <p>ETW collects information from and about users of our Site: (i) directly from you when you provide it to us; and (ii) automatically when you use the Site.</p>

              <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> When you access or use the Site we may ask you to provide personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"). For example, we require customers who register to use the Site to give us the following personal information: their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the identity of users within the organization that will be using the Site. When you initially express interest obtaining additional information about the Site, or when you register for the Site, we may also ask for additional types of personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, etc. We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized experience or verify your passwords.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer Data:</strong> Any content or information submitted by users of the Site is referred to herein as "Customer Data". Customer Data is controlled by the ETW customer who created the user account from which the Customer Data was submitted. ETW collects or processes Customer Data on behalf of this Customer, not the user who submitted it. Examples of Customer Data include customized attributes and the canonical data models. If you are using the Site at the invitation of a Customer, whether that Customer is your employer or not, that Customer determines its own policies, including without limitation policies regarding permissions, storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing and retention of Customer Data which may apply to your use of the Site. Please consult with your Customer about the policies and settings it has in place.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3> Information Collected Automatically and Tracking</h3>
              <p>When you access ETW properties we may automatically collect: (i) usage details (including your internet browser traffic data, location data, communication data and the resources you access and use through the Site and Services); (ii) device information (including device type, device settings, crash data, IP address, operating system, browser type, hardware ID, and mobile network information); (iii) stored information (including metadata and other information associated with the files stored on your device, such as cookies and local storage user preferences); and (iv) location information (including real-time information about the location of your device).

              <p>Do Not Track (DNT) signals are signals sent through a browser informing us that you do not want to be tracked. We do not assign any meaning to DNT signals as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Information Collection Technologies.</strong> The technologies we use for automatic information collection may include cookies (or mobile cookies) or web beacons.
